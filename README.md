**libsodium for .NET** is a C# wrapper around [libsodium](https://libsodium.org/),
created for .NET Framework by [@adamcaudill](https://github.com/adamcaudill/) in 2013 ("libsodium-net") and
ported to .NET Standard 2.0 by [@tabrath](https://github.com/tabrath/) in 2017 ("libsodium-core").
As of 2020, *libsodium for .NET* is no longer under active development, with only minor bug fixes being released rather infrequently.
Going forward, it is recommended to use one of the [alternative bindings for .NET](https://doc.libsodium.org/bindings_for_other_languages).
